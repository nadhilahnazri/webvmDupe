# Madani: WebVM Terminal Games

Welcome to **Madani's WebVM Terminal Games**, a project submitted to the WebVM Hackathon! This repository showcases how WebVM can be used to run simple terminal-based games, offering a lightweight, fast, and responsive gaming experience. Our concept revolves around creating a virtual terminal specifically for gaming.

## Project Overview

This project explores the potential of **WebVM** to run terminal-based games more efficiently than standard environments. WebVM's unique virtual machine features help optimize performance for lightweight applications, such as simple games, by reducing the overhead associated with traditional platforms. 

Our repository includes several Python-based games to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. These examples show how WebVM can make gaming faster and more accessible, all while running in a virtualized terminal.

## Games Included

We have included a few classic terminal games as part of the project:

1. **Snake Game**
   - A classic snake game rendered in ASCII art.
   - Sourced from [jaminthorns/ascii-snake](https://github.com/jaminthorns/ascii-snake).

2. **Minesweeper**
   - A terminal-based version of the popular minesweeper game.
   - Sourced from [niel-conradie/minesweeper](https://github.com/niel-conradie/minesweeper).

3. **Tic-Tac-Toe**
   - A simple, text-based two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.
   - Sourced from [qianguigui1104/tictactoe](https://gist.github.com/qianguigui1104/edb3b11b33c78e5894aad7908c773353).
  
4. **Ninvaders**
   - Terminal version of space invaders.

Each game is written in Python and can be run inside the WebVM terminal.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with our WebVM terminal games, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/madani-webvm-terminal-games.git
   
## Why Use WebVM for Gaming?

By running terminal-based games in WebVM, we take advantage of the following benefits:

- **Reduced Overhead**: Games run with less latency compared to typical environments due to WebVM's lightweight nature.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: WebVM is platform-independent, allowing games to run seamlessly in any browser without worrying about specific OS requirements.
- **Improved Performance**: WebVM optimizes execution for simple applications like terminal games, resulting in faster and more responsive gameplay.

## Future Plans

Other possibilities to crafting the impossible include:

- Add more games to the library.
- Optimize the terminal environment further for better gaming experiences.
- Collaborate with the community to improve performance and add new features.
